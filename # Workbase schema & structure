# Workbase schema & structure
One setup = 1 Database
Using sqlite for easy maintenance

Within the DB ther will be multiple tables.
Each table will multiple customisable actions and views.
1. Add data form
2. View data (with filters) -> Filters are customizable and a set of filters can be saved as a "saved view"
(Join table option to fetch data from other tables for viewing)
3. Search data (multiple pages, for each column) [Minimalistic]
(Join table option to fetch data from other tables for viewing)

Access control (Table wise) of actions
* Owner/Administrator = full privileges
Privileges
* View = To view data and filter & Search
* Add = Add data
* Delete data / Update / Edit data
* Approve = Confirm add data
* Settings = change settings
# Option for admin to approve data entry
-> Groups can be created with a combination of above privileges

My personal use case:
* Books read, movies seen database (Nice colorful tags with powerful filters)
* Links database
* To do list (With completed and not completed tags, target time stamp)
* Notification option by date.

Organisational use case:
* Malkhana records (Basic entry, edit, and search)
* Accused records (Basic entry, edit, and search)
* Stolen vehicle records (Basic entry, edit, and search)
